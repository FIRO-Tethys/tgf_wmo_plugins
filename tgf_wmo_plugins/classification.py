"""Shared flood hazard classification from four EF5 exceedance-probability rasters.

Port of `clasificar_peligro` from the UFFIS PBI Actividad 2 notebook. Each input
raster holds P(flood depth >= threshold) for one depth, and each hazard level has
a probability gate. A pixel takes the level of the DEEPEST threshold whose gate it
clears, which falls out of assigning the levels in ascending order and letting
later assignments win -- exactly as the notebook does it.

Note on the inputs: the layer names below follow the notebook (7.62 / 10 / 30 /
76 cm), but three of the source files are actually 15.24 / 30.48 / 60.96 cm
(6/12/24 inch) thresholds. The naming was inherited from upstream; the ordering
is correct either way, so the classification is unaffected.

This module holds no plugin of its own. The hazard classification is surfaced
as a map layer (`hazard_layer`) and as an exposure table (`impact_summary`);
a heatmap of the classified grid used to live here too, but it duplicated the
map layer's computation without adding anything the map does not show better.
