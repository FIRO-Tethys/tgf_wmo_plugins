"""Shared helpers for the flood-map visualizations.

The ensemble summary (one row per storm) is precomputed and stored beside the Zarr
store, because computing it live means reading every storm's depth array -- about
108 MB. Only the per-storm depth histogram touches the arrays themselves, and it
reads a single chunk.
